# Star-Shooters
Star Shooters

Star Shooters was a concept I had that I quickly threw together in Unity over a couple of days when I knew nothing of Unity. The game focuses on the mechanic of top-down bullet shooters, where you charge up energy by grazing bullets, allowing you to shoot back. I think it's a neat idea that could potentially be expanded upon. For now, this will sit here, gathering dust though.

2020 update:
I've got a bit of spare time and wanted to see what I'd be able to do now that I'm a lot wiser and know a lot more since I initially came up with this idea in 2016.

Ideas:
Dialogue system - I've never actually made one. Ever. And I'd like to change that, because I think it's a useful thing to do at least once.
Bullet system - The bullet patterns seen in these sorts of games are always really interesting, so I'd like to try implementing one.
Wave spawn system - Typically, enemies spawn in groups, and then the next wave spawns after a set time, or after the current wave is destroyed. I should make a system for that.

For art, I should be able to find stuff online. Cohesion might be tough, but this is proof of concept.
Same with audio.
Writing, I will fumble. Probably no *real* story.
