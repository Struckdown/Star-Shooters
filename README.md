Star Shooters

Star Shooters was a concept I had that I quickly threw together in Unity over a couple of days when I knew nothing of Unity. The game focuses on the mechanic of top-down bullet shooters, where you charge up energy by grazing bullets, allowing you to shoot back. I think it's a neat idea that could potentially be expanded upon. For now, this will sit here, gathering dust though.
