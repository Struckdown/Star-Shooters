# Star-Shooters
Star Shooters

Star Shooters was a concept I had that I quickly threw together in Unity over a couple of days when I knew nothing of Unity. The game focuses on the mechanic of top-down bullet shooters, where you charge up energy by grazing bullets, allowing you to shoot back. I think it's a neat idea that could potentially be expanded upon. ~~For now, this will sit here, gathering dust though.~~

2020 update:
I've got a bit of spare time and wanted to see what I'd be able to do now that I'm a lot wiser and know a lot more since I initially came up with this idea in 2016.

Ideas:
* ~~Dialogue system - I've never actually made one. Ever. And I'd like to change that, because I think it's a useful thing to do at least once.~~ - I did end up doing this!
* ~~Bullet system - The bullet patterns seen in these sorts of games are always really interesting, so I'd like to try implementing one.~~ - Done!
* ~~Wave spawn system - Typically, enemies spawn in groups, and then the next wave spawns after a set time, or after the current wave is destroyed. I should make a system for that.~~ Done!
